ABOUT

This is a sample project that includes a Makefile and a SPECfile to generate noarch RPM packages. With a bit of Makefile and rpmbuild knowledge you can extend this files to
do any kind of package, including build steps, etc. This sample also supports git URLs and git tags for versioning.

INSTRUCTIONS

TWEAK Makefile

You must tweak the above variables in Makefile:

   NAME: this defines the project name, package name and specfile name;
   SUMMARY, GROUP, LICENSE, VENDOR: self explanatory;
   PREFIX: the directory prefix where the package will be installed (ex.: /usr, /opt, /usr/local). This usually can be specified during package installation;

If you are NOT using GIT for versioning, tweak VERSION and URL. You can do it inside the ifeq structures.

Tweak TAR_DIRS, preptar and tar to setup which files will be packaged and how. The idea here is to generate a tarfile containing the file structure that is supposed to be
created inside the PREFIX directory when the package is installed.

TWEAK SPECfile

Tweak %file section acording to your project. This section describes files included in the package and it's permissions and ownership.

Tweak %changelog at will
